## Introduction

The E-commerce Website project is aimed at creating a full-fledged e-commerce platform that provides users with a seamless online shopping experience. The project is divided into two main parts: the backend, which handles data management and serves API endpoints, and the frontend, responsible for interacting with users.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Node.js: A runtime environment for building server-side logic.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create robust APIs.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
- REST API: The communication protocol used to interact with the backend.

### Frontend (Currently Working On)
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A state management library for managing the application's global state.

## Features

The E-commerce Website project includes the following features:

- User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and log in to the platform.
- User Profiles: Users can view and manage their profiles and account settings.
- Admin Portals: Different admin portals for managing products, orders, and inventory.
- Secure Cart System: Users can add products to their carts and proceed to checkout.
- Admin-Only Resources: Certain resources and functionalities are accessible to administrators only.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend: `npm install`
3. Set up your MongoDB database and update the connection details in the backend configuration.
4. Configure environment variables (if applicable).
5. Start the backend server: `npm run start`
6. Start the frontend development server: `npm run start`

## Currently Working On

The project is currently focused on two main tasks:

1. **Frontend Development**: The frontend is being developed using React and Redux to create an interactive user interface. Users can browse products, add them to their carts, and proceed to checkout.

2. **Payment Gateway Integration (Backend)**: Integration of a payment gateway into the backend for secure payment processing.

3. **Deployment**: Preparing the application for deployment on a hosting platform of choice, such as Heroku, AWS, or Netlify. Ensuring that all environment variables are properly set and following deployment best practices.
